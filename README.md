# CTORRUBIA - SoloProject - Northcoders News API

## Background

This repo will contain the back-end solo project proposed by the Northcoders Full-Stack bootcamp, in this project I will make use of my knowledge of back-end tools to mimic a back-end service. 

## Set-up

If you as an user want to have a look to this project, you will first need to set-up your folder once you have cloned it. To do so: 
You will need to create two .env files for your project: `.env.test` and `.env.development.` Into each, add `PGDATABASE=<database_name_here>`, with the correct database name for that environment (see /db/setup.sql for the database names). Double check that these `.env files` are `.gitignored`.
