# CTORRUBIA - Northcoders News API

## Background

**CTORRUBIA - Northcoders News API** is a [node-postgres](https://node-postgres.com/) back-end API for a Reddit-style news website. The intention here was to mimic the building of a real world backend service (such as reddit) which will provide this information to the front end architecture.

The database used was PSQL, and interactions have been carried out using node-postgres.
